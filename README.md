This is the Shell Scripting Programs and the same program is written in python:

To run Python Script (suppose filename is 'file.py') then,
>python file.py

OR

>chmod +x file.py
>./file.py

To run Shell Script (suppose filename is 'file.sh') then,
>bash file.sh

OR

>chmod +x file.sh
>./file.sh
